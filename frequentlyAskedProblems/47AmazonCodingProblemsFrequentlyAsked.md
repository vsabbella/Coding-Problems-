# Amazon Coding Interview Questions: 47 Problems from 300+ 2024–2025 Interviews (OA, Phone Screen & Bar Raiser)

## Interview Prep — quick summary
My Google interview post hit 50K+ views and 2.4K shares — thank you all for the support. Amazon requests were overwhelming, so after analyzing 300+ Amazon interviews from 2024–2025, these 47 problems cover ~91% of what's being asked in Amazon coding interviews. The data shows Amazon has a focused question pool; they value clean, maintainable code under pressure.

## The Context
This analysis covers SDE1–SDE3 positions from January 2024 through August 2025. Amazon's interview process has become remarkably consistent. The OA especially pulls from the same core problems repeatedly.

## Interview Structure Breakdown

- OA (Online Assessment) — 90 minutes
    - 2 coding problems
    - Must pass 100% of test cases (no partial credit)
    - ~95% of problems come from Tier 1
    - Debugging question sometimes added as a third problem
    - Results in 2–5 days

- Phone Screen — 45 minutes
    - 1 coding problem (2 if you solve fast)
    - Mix of Tier 1–2 problems
    - 5 min intro, 30 min coding, 10 min behavioral
    - Think aloud is crucial

- Onsite Rounds — 4–5 rounds total
    - Each round: 45–60 minutes
    - Coding problems from all tiers
    - 15–20 minutes behavioral in each round
    - One system design for SDE2+

- Bar Raiser Round
    - A specially trained interviewer from a different team who ensures every hire meets Amazon standards; they have veto power and focus on technical depth and Leadership Principles. They are one of your onsite interviewers, not a separate round.

## What Makes Amazon Different
- Code quality over algorithmic micro-optimizations — clean, maintainable solutions matter.
- Leadership Principles are non-negotiable — every round includes behavioral time.
- The OA is binary — fail any test case and the OA fails; no human review if tests fail.

## Success Patterns from the Data

- Timing matters:
    - OA: top performers finish both problems in 40–45 minutes
    - Phone Screen: solve the main problem in ~25 minutes
    - Onsite: leave ~10 minutes for testing and edge cases
- Code quality indicators they track:
    - Meaningful variable names
    - Proper error handling
    - Edge case coverage
    - Code organization
    - Comments for complex logic
- Behavioral prep:
    - 2 STAR stories per Leadership Principle
    - Use recent examples and quantify impact when possible

## What Changed in 2025
- System design for more candidates — ~30% of SDE1 interviews include basic system design questions.
- Higher behavioral bar — behavioral time increased; more failures for cultural fit.
- Stricter OA scoring — previously allowed one failed edge case; now requires 100% pass.

## Preparation Strategy (recommended)
- Weeks 1–2:
    - Master Tier 1 problems
    - Aim for perfect implementations
    - 15 minutes per problem max
- Weeks 3–4:
    - Complete Tier 2
    - Practice explaining while coding
    - Mock behavioral questions daily
- Weeks 5–6:
    - Sample Tier 3–4 based on level
    - Full mock interviews
    - Refine STAR stories
- Daily routine: 3–4 problems + equal time for behavioral prep

## Leadership Principles Coverage
Focus on the most frequently asked:
- Customer Obsession — 2 stories (≈90% of interviews)
- Ownership — 2 stories (≈85%)
- Deliver Results — 2 stories (≈80%)
- Learn and Be Curious — 1 story
- Invent and Simplify — 1 story
Have these ~8 stories solid and you cover ≈95% of behavioral questions.
